title: Winter Refresh
---

Winter Refresh is an advanced drink serving machine. It has a couple of
config options.

## Configuration

By default, you shoud have this config:

```lua
return {
    ["PourTime"] = 5, -- Total time each pour will take. NOTE: SFX will not update with this.
    ["Debug"] = true, -- Logs certain things to the console. Reccomended to be false unless having issues.
    ["LedFlash"] = true, -- Whether or not LED flashing is on. Decoration only.
}
```

- `PourTime` - The total time each pour will take. The SFX will not update to match this.
- `Debug` - Logs things to the console. Reccomended if having issues.
- `LedFlash` - Decoration only. Controls the flashing of the LEDs on the front.

## Adding Drinks

To add drinks, please look inside: `Screen > Screen > SurfaceGui > Wrapper > Drinks > DrinksGrid`

Duplicate one of the existing drinks. Drink name is taken from
the name of the button. The drink colour is an attribute called `DrinkColour`,
on each button. You will need to create an image.

:::warning
The button needs to be an ImageButton. This script does not support TextButtons.
