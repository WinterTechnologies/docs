title: Discord Webhook Proxy

# Winter Proxy

Winter Proxy is a free and open source discord webhook proxy. It is designed
for Roblox developers who want to use Discord webhooks, as Discord blocks
all webhook requests that come from Roblox servers. Currently, Winter Proxy isn't
hosted by us, you have to host it yourself, but it is something we are looking
to do in the near future.

The difference between Winter Proxy and other proxies is that it is designed
for private use, you can host your own instance, and it has authentication
features built in that stop anyone from abusing it. If you would like to host a
public one, it's also fully possible to do that just by setting `AUTH_ENABLED`
to `false` inside your .env file.

## Deployment

### Vercel

The quickest way to deploy Winter Proxy is to use [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
Vercel offer a free Hobby tier for developers, which may be enough for you
depending on how much you use it. You can deploy it by clicking the button below:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwintertechnologies%2Fproxy&env=API_TOKEN,AUTH_ENABLED&envDescription=API_TOKEN%20is%20used%20if%20you%20have%20AUTH_ENABLED%20set%20to%20true.%20If%20you%20don't%20want%20authentication%2C%20set%20AUTH_ENABLED%20to%20false.&project-name=winter-proxy&repository-name=winter-proxy)

To generate your `API_TOKEN`, I reccomend using openssl. This will generate a 32
byte long random string for you to use.

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

For more info about authentication, see the [Authentication](#authentication) section.

### Self hosted

Self hosting Winter Proxy is not too complicated, but you will require a decent
amount of knowledge about Docker, NextJS, and whatever OS you're using (probably linux if on a server).
Here are the rough steps you'll need to follow:

1. Clone the repo
2. Build the nextjs app (`pnpm run build`)
3. Build the docker image (`docker build -t winter-proxy .`)
4. Run the docker image (`docker run -p 3000:3000 -e AUTH_ENABLED=true -e API_TOKEN=<API_TOKEN> winter-proxy`)

You can now access the web ui at `http://localhost:3000/`, and the API at `http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/<WEBHOOK_ID>/<WEBHOOK_TOKEN>`

For more info about docker, see [their docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-overview/).

## Usage

To use Winter Proxy after deployment, copy your webhook url from discord, and replace
`discord.com` with the URL of your server. There is also a convenient web UI for
quickly converting URLs.

### Authentication

If you have authentication enabled, you will need to add the `winterapitoken` key
to the body of your request. Set the value to the API key you set during deployment.
Here's an example json body:

```json
{
  "content": "Hello from Winter Proxy!",
  "winterapitoken": "<API_TOKEN>"
}
```
